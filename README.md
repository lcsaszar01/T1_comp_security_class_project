# T1_comp_security_class_project

Usage for GUI, developed in Python using PyQt5 and UI designer, QT
* Please note that this interface was designed on a WINDOWS machine *

Steps for running the code on the device: 
1) python -m venv env
2) env\Scripts\activate.bat (WINDOWS) 
   source env/bin/activate (MAX/LINUS)
3) pip install pyside6
4) python .\cipherGUI.py (Wherever file is located on your machine)

Tip: The greatest pain in any interface is making a system that actually works 
and there isn't some sort of discrepancy somewhere. This is pure pain...
